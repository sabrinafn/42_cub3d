**cub3D**


This project was part of the 42 school curriculum and marked our first real dive into 3D rendering using raycasting, inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. The idea was to create a basic game where the player can move through a 2D map and experience a simulated 3D perspective.

It was a team project, developed by **Marcela Gonzaga** and me. Working together was one of the most valuable parts of the experience. We split tasks, helped each other debug, and had many discussions to make sure we were always aligned in how we approached each challenge.

Another major part of the project was learning how to use Git effectively in a collaborative setting. We worked with multiple branches, handled many merges, and learned how to manage conflicts and stay organized as a team. The project was forked from the base repository provided by the school, and from there we built up our own version step by step.

More than just a technical exercise, this project was a great lesson in teamwork, communication, and version controlâ€”all essential skills for real-world development.
